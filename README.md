# Project Description
This project is a simulation for a scheduler in an operating system using the Buddy system as a memory management technique. There are three scheduling algorithms that you can choose from:

1. HPF (Highest Priority First)
2. RR (Round Robin) with a quanta of your own choice
3. SRTN (Shortest Remaining Time Next)
