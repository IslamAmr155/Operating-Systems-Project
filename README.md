# Project Description
This project is a simulation for a scheduler in an operating system using the Buddy system as a memory management technique. There are three scheduling algorithms that you can choose from:


1. HPF (Highest Priority First)
2. RR (Round Robin) with a quanta of your own choice
3. SRTN (Shortest Remaining Time Next)

# How to run
Clone the repo or download the code and then build the project by running the command `make build` in the terminal. Run the project using the command `make os` and then choose the scheduling algorithm you want to run.
